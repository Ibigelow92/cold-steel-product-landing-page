            <p>Taking inspiration from the classic "Trench Knives" from both World Wars of the last century, we have developed a series of tactical fixed blades that are suitable for the challenges faced by today's modern day warriors. Our Chaos fixed blades are equipped with unique "D" ring guards made from reinforced 6061 aluminum, allowing for an incredibly secure and comfortable grip while protecting the hand both from incoming attack and damage while striking or cutting an opponent who's covered in body armor, ammo, flashlights, magazines and gear! Their extra thick 1055 carbon steel pommels are tapered to concentrate the percussive force of a hammering strike, and their full tang SK-5 High Carbon steel blades are expertly heat treated for maximum performance. Their tough Secure-Ex sheaths are Molle-Lok and Tek-Lok compatible with rugged adjustable Cor-Ex belt loops and retaining straps for a secure and reliable lock up when not in use. The Chaosseries combine maximum safety and security with extreme performance and combat potential.</p>

            <p>Finally, a D-guard push knife designed from the ground up to thrive in the toughest military and special operations environments. Made with a broad, double edged blade that's honed to razor sharpness, it cuts, slashes and thrusts like a chainsaw on steroids. But it's the D-guard handle that really makes it unique as it offers unprecedented protection for you hand and fingers. The handle is injection molded form Griv-Ex™ with Kray-Ex™ over-molds for comfort and shock resistance. It allows for multi-directional percussion blows due to its twin skull crusher pommels, which are removable. The Secure-Ex® sheath is highly functional and comes with a Cordura belt loop, so the Chaos Push Knife can be carried at your side at all times.</p>
